# MultiTenantCache
Determine a policy to use the underutilized storage and compute resources in a multi-tenant memory disaggregated database to optimize performance.  To provide isolation guarantee the multi-tenant databases require allocation of resources for simultaneous maximum utilization. In practice, these resource capacities defined for worst case operations are under-utilized. The project explores allocation policies to leverage the unused resources to improve performance. Isolation guarantee when limited to a period of time, lets a multi-tenant caching system leverage the underutilized memory resources.
